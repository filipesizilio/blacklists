# Sizilio's Blacklists
Blacklists of some boring game and software domains.

I decided to join here some lists with hostnames that I didn't find in other lists and that I like to block.
Maybe it will work for more people. And I recommend to use Pi-hole DNS server.

This is a personal project for my very specific goals. Use at your own risk! I am not responsible for problems on your network.

### My Lists 
#### Games (addictive for my daughters)
  - Roblox
  - PK-XD

#### Softwares (annoying apps accessing the network unnecessarily)
  - Adobe
  - Autodesk
  - Corel
  - Topaz

### Others Lists under construction
- Youtube (intend to block all YouTube on the network. Recommend group/user/client management. May affect other google services)
- TikTok (intend to block all TikTok on the network. Yes! It's necessary for the mental health of your loved ones)
- Trackers (a few trackers, such as facebook and instagram. Does not affect access)
- Ads and Suspicious (some ads and some suspicious domains, that I don't know what they are for)

That's just it for now!
